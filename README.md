## ⛰️ Why Slope?

In the fast-paced world of software engineering, consistent practice is the only way to stay sharp. Slope is designed to:
- **Minimize Friction**: Get from problem discovery to code execution in seconds.
- **Enhance Learning**: Detailed feedback and performance metrics to help you understand *where* you can improve.
- **Foster Community**: A place to share solutions, discuss strategies, and grow together.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- **🚀 Integrated Development Environment**: A powerful web-based code editor with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and multi-language support.
- **🧪 Real-time Testing**: Execute your code against pre-defined test cases and see results instantly.
- **📊 Comprehensive Problem Sets**: A curated list of problems ranging from "Easy" to "Hard", categorized by topics (Arrays, DP, Graphs, etc.).
- **🏆 Leaderboards & Progress Tracking**: Compete with others and visualize your growth over time.
- **🔒 Secure Sandbox Execution**: Code execution is handled in an isolated environment to ensure security and performance.
